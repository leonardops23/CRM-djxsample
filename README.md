# Task Management Application

This is a Task Management application built using **Django** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in an intuitive interface. The frontend is served as a client application in the `/client` directory, and it communicates with the Django backend via a REST API.

## Features

- Create new tasks with a title and description.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks with a confirmation prompt.
- View tasks in a responsive, card-based layout.
- Task list with hover animations and delete buttons.
- Backend API developed with Django for CRUD operations.
- Frontend developed using React with TailwindCSS for styling.
